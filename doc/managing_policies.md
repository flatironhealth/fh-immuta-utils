Policies
========

fh-immuta-utils supports creating global policies to limit access to data sources based on tags.
The intended use-case is where access to sensitive data is granted on the basis of membership in IAM groups,
where sensitive columns in data sources are tagged as such.

The repo provides a script that can create, update, and remove policies based on provided policy spec files.

As an example, imagine that the following data policy spec file is used:

``` yaml
DATA_POLICIES:
  policy_1:
    actions:
      - type: "masking"  # mask fields
        description: ""
        rules:
          - type: "masking"  # using hashing
            config:
              fields:
                tags: ["tag1"]  # for fields tagged with "tag1"
            exceptions:
              operator: "and"
              conditions:
                - type: "groups"
                  iam_groups: ["group1"]  # except if user is a member of "group1"
    circumstances:
      - operator: "or"
        type: "columnTags"
        tags: ["tag1"]  # on data sources with columns tagged "tag1"
```

To apply RBAC based on this policy, you can run the following:

``` bash
$ conda activate fh-immuta-utils
$ fh-immuta-utils policies --config-file foo.yml --type data
```

Running the script above will generate a new global data policy named `policy_1_access_policy` that will:
* **action** --> mask fields tagged `tag1` using hashing for everyone except when user is a member of group `group1`
* **circumstance** --> on data sources with columns tagged `tag1`

Operators allow for stringing together separate conditions, and separate circumstances. The accepted values are `or` and `and`.

Available types:
* `Masking` is the only currently implemented `action` and `rule` type.
* `Groups` is the only currently implemented `condition` type.
* `columnTags` and `tags` are the only currently implemented `circumstance` types:
  * `columnTags` applies the policy to data sources with specific column tags
  * `tags` applies the policy to data sources with specific tags on the data source itself


The utility also allows creating subscription policies where access to a data source is based on
membership in a particular IAM group.

As an example consider following subscription policy.

```yaml
SUBSCRIPTION_POLICIES:
  subscription_1:
    staged: false
    actions: # do not subscribe to a data source
      - exceptions:
          operator: "or"
          conditions:
            - type: "groups"
              iam_groups: ["group01"] # except if the user is member of "group01"
        allowDiscovery: false
        automaticSubscription: true
    circumstances:
      - operator: "or"
        type: "tags"
        tags: ["tag01"] # for data source tagged with "tag01"
```
To apply RBAC based on this policy, you can run the following:

``` bash
$ conda activate fh-immuta-utils
$ fh-immuta-utils policies --config-file foo.yml --type subscription
```

Running the script above will generate a new global subscription policy named `subscription_1_subscription_policy` that will:
* **action** --> not subscribe data sources for everyone except when user is a member of group `group01`
* **circumstance** --> for data sources tagged `tag01`

Operators on conditions and circumstances are same as described above for data policies.

*Note*: To apply both data and subscription policies skip the `--type` argument which defaults to
both data and subscription policies being applied.
